## Responsive Navbar
The app's navbar is dynamic and changes based on the user's device screen size. On desktop devices, the navbar is always visible and displays all of the available projects. On mobile devices, the navbar is hidden by default, but can be accessed by clicking on the hamburger icon in the top left corner.

When the user clicks on the hamburger icon, the navbar slides in from the left and displays a list of all available projects. The user can then select a project to view its associated tasks. If the user clicks outside of the navbar, it will slide back out of view.

This dynamic navbar ensures that the app is easy to use and navigate on both desktop and mobile devices, and provides a smooth and intuitive user experience.
